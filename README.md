# Curle Analogy

This is a implementation of the modified Curle acoustic analogy presented by Larsson et al. [1] as well as the Ffowcs-Williams-Hawkings analogy described by Farassat [2] as functionObject for OpenFOAM 4.x and dev. The method is implemented for incompressible cases.

The repository includes the source files for compilation. Furthermore, mesh and setup for the tandem cylinder validation case are provided [3].
